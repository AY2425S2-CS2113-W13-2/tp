## Overview
Our team developed **EventSync**, a smart event scheduling and management application designed for seamless coordination. It enables users to create, update, and manage events efficiently while ensuring minimal conflicts and optimal scheduling.

I focused on implementing key functionalities for event management, optimizing performance, and ensuring robust testing through JUnit test cases.

## Enhancements Implemented

### Core Event Management Features (v1.0)
- **Implemented the following commands:**
    - `addEventCommand`: Allows users to create new events with customizable details.
    - `listCommand`: Displays all upcoming events in an organized format.

- **Helped with overall code structure:**
    - Refactored event-related classes to follow the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.
    - Improved modularity by separating **event command**, **paser**, and **UI interaction**.
    - Optimized event handling with **efficient data structures**.

### New Features and Enhancements (v2.0)
- **Added new commands:**
    - `addParticipantCommand`: Allows users to add participants to existing events with availability checks.
    - `createUserCommand`: Allows users to create new accounts and register with the system.
    - `LoginCommand`: Enables user authentication and session management.
    - `LogoutCommand`: Allows users to log out and generates a downloadable event schedule in CSV format.

- **Added new components:**
    - **`Storage`**:
        - A centralized storage system for all event-related data. This component ensures that events are stored persistently and can be retrieved across application sessions.
        - Stores event details such as event name, time, participants, and other metadata.
        - Uses a file-based or in-memory database (depending on your implementation) to persist event data.

    - **`UserStorage`**:
        - Manages the storage of user information, including user profiles, registration details, and availability.
        - Ensures that user data is stored securely and can be retrieved to check availability when scheduling new events.

- **Modification to `AddEventCommand`**:
        - The event creator is automatically added to the event.
        - The creatorâ€™s availability is checked to ensure there are no scheduling conflicts.
        - The event details are saved in `Storage` for future retrieval.

- **Added new command factories:**
