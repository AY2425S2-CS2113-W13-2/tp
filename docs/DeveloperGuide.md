![Storage Class Diagram](images/class_diagram.png)

#### API: UserStorage.java

The `UserStorage` component,

- is responsible for saving and loading user-related data, including participant details.
- stores data in a structured format, ensuring persistence across sessions. (sample: Alice | MEMBER | 123 | 2025-03-31 12:00,2025-05-31 12:00)
- depends on `Participant` as it manages participant-related storage operations.

#### API: Storage.java

The `Storage` component,

- handles the storage and retrieval of both event and priority data.
- integrates `UserStorage` to manage participant-related information.
- can save and load events, including participant details and scheduling information.
- depends on `UserStorage`, `Event`, and `Priority` as it manages multiple data types.
- throws `SyncException` to handle potential storage errors.

## Design & Implementation

### Add Event Feature

#### Implementation
The `AddEventCommand` feature allows users to add an event to their schedule. It is implemented using the `Command` pattern, where `AddEventCommand` extends `Command`.

1. **User Input Parsing**: The `Parser` class processes user input and creates an `AddEventCommand` instance.
2. **Event Storage**: The event details are stored in an `Event` object, which is added to an `EventList`.
3. **Feedback to User**: A confirmation message is displayed to inform the user of successful event creation.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design?**
    - The `Command` pattern allows easy extension for future commands.
    - Using an `EventList` simplifies storage and retrieval.

### Edit Event Feature

#### Implementation

The `EditEventCommand` feature allows users to modify an existing event.

1. **User Input Parsing**: The `Parser` prompts the user for the index of the event they want to edit.
2. **Modification Flow**: The user is guided through inputs to edit event fields (e.g., name, time, location, etc.).
3. **Update Storage**: The original event is updated in the `EventList`.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design?**
  - Enables users to fix or update event details without needing to delete and recreate them.
  - Reuses existing input and validation logic, keeping the system modular.


### Conflict Detector Feature
#### Implementation

The `ConflictDetector` feature checks for overlapping events in a user's schedule.
1. **Conflict Check**: Compares the start and end times of all events in EventList.
2. **Feedback to User**: If conflicts are detected, a warning message is displayed to the user.

#### Design Considerations
- **Why this design?**
  - Ensures users are aware of scheduling conflicts, preventing double-booking.
  - Improves event management by highlighting overlapping schedules.

### List Events Feature

#### Implementation
The `ListCommand` allows users to list events with custom sorting options.

1. **User Prompt**: When the user types `list`, they are asked how they want to sort the events.
2. **Sort Strategies**: 
- Implemented using the Strategy Pattern:
  - `SortByPriority`: sorts from HIGH to LOW, with a subsort by end time (earlier first).
  - `SortByStartTime`: sorts by earliest start time, then by priority (HIGH first).
  - `SortByEndTime`: sorts by earliest end time, then by priority (HIGH first).
3. **Modularity**: The `Sort` abstract class defines the contract for sorting. Each strategy class overrides it with specific logic.
4. **Non-destructive Sorting**: Events and priorities are copied into temporary lists, sorted, and displayed without altering the original list.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design?**
  - It enables flexibility and clean extension of new sort types.
  - Keeps the original data intact.
  - Allows consistent behavior across commands.

### Delete Event Feature

#### Implementation
The `DeleteCommand` feature users to remove an event from their schedule by keyword. If multiple events share the same name, users are prompted to select the correct one based on the list shown.
1. **User Input Parsing**: 
The `Parser` reads the event keyword from user input using `readDeleteName()`. `findMatchingEvents(name)` is used to gather all matching events. 
If more than one match is found, the UI shows them with indices for disambiguation.
2. **Event Deletion Flow**: The selected event is passed to `DeleteCommand` with the correct index. In `execute()`, the user is asked to confirm the deletion via `ui.confirmDeletion()`.
3. **Data Synchronization**: If confirmed, the event and its corresponding priority are removed.

#### Design Considerations
- **Why this design?**
  - Maintains consistency between the events list and the priority list.
  - Ensures safe deletion by confirming with the user.

### Priority Filter Feature

#### Implementation
The `PriorityFilter` feature allows users to filter events by priority level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH). 

1. **User Input Parsing**: The Parser class processes input in format {PRIORITY PRIORITY}.
2. **Event Filtering**: Events with priority within the range are filtered.
3. **Display**: Events are printed to the user.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design?**
  - Allows users to quickly find events with certain priorities.
  - Enhances usability by enabling customized event views.

### Duplicate Event Feature

#### Implementation
The `DuplicateEventCommand` feature allows users to duplicate an existing event to their schedule. It is implemented using the `Command` pattern, where `DuplicateEventCommand` extends `Command`.

1. **User Input Parsing**: The `Parser` class processes user input and creates an `DuplicateEventCommand` instance.
2. **Event Storage**: The duplicated event details are stored in an `Event` object, which is added to an `EventList`.
4. **Feedback to User**: The user is asked to input the index that they wish to duplicate and the new name of the event. Duplicated event is displayed to inform the user of successful event duplication.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design?**
    - The `Command` pattern allows easy extension for future commands.
    - Using an `EventList` simplifies storage and retrieval.

### Add Participant Feature

#### Implementation

The `AddParticipantCommand` feature enables users to add a participant to a specific event.

1. **User Input Parsing**: The `Parser` reads the event index, participant name, and access level (ADMIN or MEMBER).
2. **Validation**: Ensures valid access level and event index.
3. **Participant Assignment**: Adds the participant to the event.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design?**
  - Facilitates collaboration by assigning roles to users in events.
  - Enhances event detail and accountability.


### List Participants Feature

#### Implementation

The `ListParticipantsCommand` feature lists all participants assigned to a specific event.

1. **User Input Parsing**: The user inputs the index of the event.
2. **Retrieval**: Fetches and displays the participants for that event.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design?**
  - Allows users to view who's involved in an event.
  - Useful for managing group tasks or meetings.

### Storage

#### Implementation
The storage component is responsible for persisting event data across sessions.

1. **File Handling**: Data is stored in a text file (`events.txt`).
2. **Serialization**: Events are written and read in a structured format.
3. **Error Handling**: Ensures corrupted files do not crash the program by adding fallback mechanisms.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design?**
    - Using a text file ensures simplicity, portability, and easy debugging.
    - It is lightweight and does not require additional libraries or systems for data management.

## Product Scope
### Target User Profile

The target user profile for this application includes individuals who need to manage their personal or professional schedules. These users may be:

- Students who need to track assignments and exam dates.
- Professionals who need to manage meetings, deadlines, and other appointments.
- Anyone looking for a simple, easy-to-use event management tool.

### Value Proposition

This application addresses the need for a lightweight, easy-to-use solution for managing and organizing events. It provides the following value:

- **Simple Event Management**: Users can add, list, and organize their events with minimal effort.
- **Persistence**: Events are saved between application sessions, ensuring that users' data is not lost.
- **Flexibility**: It allows users to customize events and sort them in the order they choose (chronologically).

By providing these features, the application allows users to focus on their tasks and not on manually managing their schedule.
